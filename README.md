Publish UHRP Content with NanoStore

## Overview

This package allows you to create Universal Hash Resolution Protocol (UHRP) content publications and hosting contracts for files and data. Since UHRP URLs are content-addressed, they are self-authenticating. Since any UHRP host can advertise the availability of content, discovery is no longer controlled by a trusted third party as is the case with HTTP.

## Usage

Check out [NanoStore UI](https://github.com/p2ppsr/nanostore-ui) to see a file upload example with React.

The below code relies on the  [Babbage SDK](https://projectbabbage.com/sdk) to pay for a file to be hosted:

```js
const Babbage = require('@babbage/sdk')

(async () => {
// Get a reference to a File element somehow, or create one if using Node
const file = document.getElementById('file_upload_form_input').files[0]
const serverURL = 'https://nanostore.babbage.systems'

// Send an invoice to the server to get transaction outputs
const inv = await invoice({
  fileSize: file.size,
  retentionPeriod: 525600, // Host for one year
  serverURL
})

// Create an Action with Babbage SDK to pay the invoice
const tx = await Babbage.createAction({
  outputs: inv.outputs.map(x => ({
    satoshis: x.amount,
    script: x.outputScript
  })),
  description: 'Upload with NanoStore'
})

// Upload the file and submit the payment of the invoice
const response = await upload({
  referenceNumber: inv.referenceNumber,
  transactionHex: tx.rawTransaction,
  mapiResponses: tx.mapiResponses,
  inputs: tx.inputs,
  file,
  serverURL
})

// The file is now published
console.log(response)
})()
```
