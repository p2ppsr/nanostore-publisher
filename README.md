# nanostore-publisher

Publish UHRP Content with NanoStore

## Overview

This package allows you to create Universal Hash Resolution Protocol (UHRP) content publications and hosting contracts for files and data. Since UHRP URLs are content-addressed, they are self-authenticating. Since any UHRP host can advertise the availability of content, discovery is no longer controlled by a trusted third party as is the case with HTTP.

Once you've uploaded, the content is available with [NanoSeek](https://github.com/p2ppsr/nanoseek), which automatically checks the integrity of the data.

## Example Usage

Check out [NanoStore UI](https://github.com/p2ppsr/nanostore-ui) to see a file upload example with React.

All the example code relies on the [Babbage SDK](https://projectbabbage.com/sdk) to pay for a file to be hosted:

```js
import { invoice, pay, upload } from 'nanostore-publisher'

// First, get "file" from an HTML file upload input.
// If you use React, get "file" from your form in the normal React-y way :)
const file = document.getElementById('upload').files[0]

// Decide how long the file is to be hosted on NanoStore.
// This is a number of minutes.
const hostingMinutes = 60 * 24 * 30 // For example, 30 days

// If not provided, the default nanostore URL is 'https://nanostore.babbage.systems'
const serverURL = 'https://nanostore.babbage.systems'

// Get an invoice for a file with this size and hosting duration
const invoice = await invoice({
  fileSize: file.size,
  retentionPeriod: hostingMinutes,
  config: {
    nanostoreURL: serverURL
  }
})

// Automatically pay the invoice with the Babbage SDK
const pay = await pay({
  config: {
    nanostoreURL: serverURL
  },
  description: 'NanoStore Publisher Example', // Shown to the Babbage user
  orderID: invoice.ORDER_ID,
  recipientPublicKey: invoice.identityKey,
  amount: invoice.amount // This is the cost in satoshis
})

// After the payment, the file can be uploaded to NanoStore
const upload = await upload({
  config: {
    nanostoreURL: serverURL
  },
  uploadURL: pay.uploadURL,
  publicURL: invoice.publicURL,
  file,
  serverURL,
  onUploadProgress: prog => { // You can get progress updates
    console.log(
      'Progress:',
      parseInt((prog.loaded / prog.total) * 100)
    )
  }
})

// You'll get the UHRP hash and the public URL after upload
console.log({
  hash: upload.hash,
  publicURL: upload.publicURL
})
```

### Invoice, Pay and Upload

As you can see in the above code, there are three phases to the publication of content with this library. First, an invoice is created where you specify the file size and the retention period of the content you are uploading. Then, you pay for the content, and finally, the content is uploaded to NanoStore.

Here's a more customized example. We've separated the "pay" phase into its `derivePaymentInfo` and `submitPayment` component parts, allowing for a custom transaction to be constructed. This is useful if, for example, there is a need for multiple outputs going to different places:

```js
import [ invoice, derivePaymentInfo, submitPayment, upload ] from 'nanostore-publisher'
import { createAction } from '@babbage/sdk'

// Create an invoice, like normal
const invoice = await invoice({
  fileSize: file.size,
  retentionPeriod: 86400
})

// Get the information needed for making the payment
const paymentInfo = await derivePaymentInfo({
  recipientPublicKey: invoice.identityKey,
  amount: invoice.amount // This is the cost in satoshis
})

// Create a custom transaction, potentially with other outputs
const payment = await createAction({
  description: 'Custom payment',
  outputs: [
    { script: '016a', satoshis: 1 }, // ...custom outputs
    paymentInfo.output               // payment output
  ]
})

// Submit the payment after the transaction is complete
const payment = await submitPayment({
  orderID: invoice.ORDER_ID,
  amount: invoice.amount,
  payment,
  derivationPrefix: paymentInfo.derivationPrefix,
  derivationSuffix: paymentInfo.derivationSuffix,
  vout: 1 // The payment output was at index 1 in the outputs array
})

// Upload the file as normal
const upload = await upload({
  uploadURL: pay.uploadURL,
  publicURL: invoice.publicURL,
  file
})
```

Note, in the above example, that the two low-level payment functions **replace** the high-level `pay` function.

### Simplified File Publishing

If you simply want to publish a single file with default behavior, you can make use of the `publishFile` function.

**Example Usage in a React UI**

```javascript
 // Publish the uploaded file
const uploadResult = await publishFile({
  file,
  retentionPeriod,
  progressTracker: prog => {
    setUploadProgress(
      parseInt((prog.loaded / prog.total) * 100)
    )
  }
})

// Show the results in the UI
setResults({
  hash: uploadResult.hash,
  publicURL: uploadResult.publicURL
})
```
